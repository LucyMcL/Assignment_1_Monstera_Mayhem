            <div class="column_text_container">
              <p>Undoubtedly one of the rarest, most sought-after, and most expensive houseplants on the market, the Monstera obliqua is not for the faint of heart. A single, unrooted cutting can be very expensive, particularly if it’s mature and highly fenestrated, which means this rare Monstera is usually only grown by serious collectors. Not only is this tropical plant expensive, but it’s also slow-growing and demanding in its care. Due to all of these factors, it is extremely difficult to come across a genuine Monstera obliqua. If you’re in the market for an obliqua, it’s best to source it from a specialty plant shop, reputable collector, or importer who can guarantee its authenticity.</p>
              <p>The Monstera obliqua is frequently confused with its cousin the Monstera adansonii, which is similar in appearance. In fact, it’s common for Monstera adansoniis to be mislabeled and sold as obliquas, particularly the highly fenestrated ones. However, these two plants can be distinguished by the size and shape of the fenestrations. The obliqua develops far larger, rounder fenestrations as it matures and is known for its super-thin, delicate leaves and slow growth rate. </p>
              <p>The Monstera obliqua is particular about its growing conditions and is not ideal for houseplant beginners. It requires warm, humid temperatures that can usually only be achieved with the help of a greenhouse or terrarium. It’s sensitive to overwatering and underwatering and needs the perfect amount of light (not direct sun but ample indirect light) in order to thrive. Under the right conditions this plant can thrive when grown indoors. As with most Monsteras, the Monstera obliqua is a climbing hemiepiphyte that does best with something to climb like a moss pole or trellis.</p>

          <div class="column_grid">
            <div class="column_text_container">
              <p>Monstera siltepecana, also known as silver monstera 'El Salvador', is a tropical plant native to Mexico and Central America that's often grown as a houseplant. This climbing epiphytic vine is known for its lance-shaped juvenile leaves with silvery markings against dark green veins. In the proper conditions, mature Monstera siltepecana leaves can develop fenestrations, or holes, and lose their silvery color in favor of a deeper green. Note that Monstera siltepecana is toxic to people and pets.</p>
              <p>Monstera siltepecana grows best in rich, well-drained soil. You can use a ready-made aroid potting mix or make your own mix by combining equal parts peat moss or coconut coir, perlite, organic compost, and orchid bark.</p>
              <p>Monstera siltepecana grows best in conditions similar to its native jungle habitat. Temperatures between 60 and 95 degrees and humidity above 60 percent are ideal. Keep the plant away from cold, drafty windows and hot or cold air vents. If your space is particularly dry, run a humidifier near your plant to add moisture to the air.</p>
              <p>Feed Monstera siltepecana with a balanced houseplant fertilizer diluted to half strength once per month during the growing season. Stop fertilizing in the fall. As winter transitions to spring, keep an eye on the plant's growth. New foliage is a sign to begin fertilizing for the season.</p>
